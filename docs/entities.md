# Entities
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum/master/docs/media/entities.png">

- Integration exposes *almost* all available settings and states reverse engineered from the official App. 
- Almost all entities are dynamically exposed for specific device. If the device does not have property that tied to specific entity, integration will not add that entity to the Home Assistant.
- Some entities may not be available on devices with older firmware versions like *customized_cleaning* and *cleaning_mode* that are also not available on valetudo. 
- Most of the entities including the vacuum entity has dynamic icons for their state and can be overridden from entity settings.
- Most of the sensor and all select entities returns their current raw integer value on `raw_value`, `map_id` or `segment_id` attributes for ease of use on automations and services.
- All entities has dynamic refresh rate determined by its change range and device state. Integration only inform Home Assistant when a device property has changed through listeners. This is more like a *local_push* type of approach instead of *local_pull* but please note that it may take time entity to reflect the changes when you edit related setting from the official App.
- Some entities has custom availability rules for another specific entity or state. E.g. *tight_mopping* entity will become *unavailable* when water tank or mop pad is not attached. (All off the rules extracted from the official App)
- Exposed cloud connected entities for all available settings that are stored not on the device but on specific map data itself. E.g. *map_rotation*
- Generated entities have the following naming schema:

    `[domain].[vacuum name]_[entity name]`

> Some entities are disabled by default and some entities can be accessed over vacuum entity attributes.

### Select Entities for rooms
- Room select entities are only available with cloud connection. 
- Entities are dynamically generated from saved maps but only selected map is editable via shared room entities.
- Entity names and icons are dynamically generated from segment id, custom name or segment type  and can be overridden from entity settings (Not recommended when multi-floor map is enabled).
- Entities uses segment id system but generated from all saved maps. When multi-floor map is enabled, specific room entity may not be available on currently selected map.
- *Customized cleaning* and *custom cleaning sequence* settings are not available on devices with older firmware versions.
- Generated entities have the following naming schema:<br>`select.[vacuum name]_room_[segment id]_[room entity name]`

- Camera entities are only available with cloud connection. 
- All camera entities has different dynamic refresh rate determined by its last request time and device state.
- Camera will only render a map when an image request has been made and only render changed areas of the image.
- Saved map camera names generated dynamically from index or custom name.
- Saved map entities for multi-floor map entities uses indexing system instead of map id. <a href="https://github.com/Tasshack/dreame-vacuum/blob/master/docs/map.md#multi-floor-map-support" target="_blank">More info</a>
- Live map is not editable and renders saved map after an edit has been made until robot starts cleaning.
- *map_1* entity always renders saved map of currently selected map when multi-floor map is disabled
